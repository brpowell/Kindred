# Family App (Working Title)

This project has dependencies that can be installed from Cocoapods. If you don't have the package manager installed first follow the guide here https://cocoapods.org/

Then
```
git clone https://github.com/brpowell/familyapp
cd familyapp
pod install
```

Make sure you open the newly generated `FamilyApp.xcworkspace` and not `FamilyApp.xcodeproj`
